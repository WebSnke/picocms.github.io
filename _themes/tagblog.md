This theme is fully centered around a tag list/cloud - other means of navigation, apart from a manually built menu, have not been taken onto account.

It is a minimal theme - no javascript, no 3rd-party resources, simple CSS design without animations or rounded corners etc. It's also a responsive theme, a.k.a. mobile friendly.

Colors can be customised. Two example CSS are included.

It is - was - based on the [NotePaper](https://github.com/mayamcdougall/NotePaper) theme, but has been largely rewritten to focus on the one aspect that was most important to me.  
It also includes a modified version of the [mcb_TableOfContent](https://github.com/mcbSolutions/Pico-Plugins/tree/master/mcb_TableOfContent)plugin.
